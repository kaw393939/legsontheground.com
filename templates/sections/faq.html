                    <p>Our property scouting service helps you find the perfect place before you arrive. We'll search based on your criteria (budget, location, amenities), visit potential properties, provide detailed photos/videos, and negotiate on your behalf. Service includes up to 5 properties for $200, with flexible scheduling based on your timeline.</p>
